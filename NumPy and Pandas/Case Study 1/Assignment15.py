# 15.Analyse various school outcomes in Tennessee using pandas. Suppose you are a public school administrator. Some
# schools in your state of Tennessee are performing below average academically. Your superintendent, under pressure
# from frustrated parents and voters, approached you with the task of understanding why these schools are
# under-performing. To improve school performance, you need to learn more about these schools and their students,
# just as a business needs to understand its own strengths and weaknesses and its customers. Though you is eager to
# build an impressive explanatory model, you know the importance of conducting preliminary research to prevent
# possible pitfalls or blind spots. Thus, you engages in a thorough exploratory analysis, which includes: a lit
# review, data collection, descriptive and inferential statistics, and data visualization. Phase 1 - Data Collection
# Here is a data of every public school in middle Tennessee. The data also includes various demographic,
# school faculty, and income variables. You need to convert the data into useful information. • Read the data in
# pandas data frame • Describe the data to find more details
